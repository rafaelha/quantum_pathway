# Introduction to Quantum Computers

### Installation instructions

Install Jupyter notebook with the Anaconda distribution as described [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You will need a free account at [IBM Q](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/)
that gives you unlimited access to the IBM quantum comuters though the cloud. 

Install [qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html) and set up your
token.

Install [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/install.html) and the plugins
[pennylane-qiskit](https://pennylane-qiskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
and [Strawberry
Fields](https://pennylane-sf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).

All set to go! Open
[intro_to_qc.ipynb](https://github.com/rafaelha/quantum_pathway/blob/master/learning_resources/01_intro_to_qc/intro_to_qc.ipynb)

NOTE: Opening the notebook within github results in a bunch of formatting
issues. For best experience, clone repository and open the notebook with
jupyter.
